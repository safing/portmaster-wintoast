# Portmaster wintoast

[WinToast](https://github.com/mohabouje/WinToast) is a lightly library written in C++ which brings a complete integration of the modern toast notifications of Windows 8 & Windows 10. This copy of the project adds Visual Studio build support and a C api layer on top so it can be used by the [Portmaster](https://github.com/safing/portmaster).
